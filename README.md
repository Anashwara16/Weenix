# Weenix

The Weenix operating system serves as a project for individuals keen on developing components of a Unix kernel. Initially crafted in 1998 by teaching assistants at Brown University, this operating system was utilized in a course overseen by Professor Tom Doeppner.

During my tenure in the Operating Systems coursework (CSCI-402) at the University of Southern California, I contributed to the development of critical kernel-level data structures and subsystems such as threads, VFS, and virtual memory within Weenix, a Unix-like operating system.

Unfortunately, due to copyright restrictions, I am unable to share the Weenix code through a public repository. However, if you are interested in reviewing the code, please feel free to reach out to me at puthlat@usc.edu.
