# Weenix

Weenix operating system is a project for people interested in writing parts of a Unix kernel. The operating system was originally written in 1998 by teaching assistants for Brown Universityâ€™s operating systems course taught by Professor Tom Doeppner. 

As part of the Operating Systems coursework, implemented key kernel-level data structures and subsystems like threads, VFS, and
Virtual memory in Weenix; an Unix-like operating system. 

Due to copyright reasons, I cannot post the weenix code on a public repository. If you are interested in looking at the code, please email me at
